Implementation of perceptron algorithms and its variants
- main.py
- perceptron.py - functions pertaining to perceptron algorithm and its variants
- data.py - handles data manipulation
- libsvm.py - handles reading the data (provided by the class. However, this could've have been implemented in data.py for the sake of organization and compactness)
- data_train - training data
- data_test - testing data
- fold1-5 - data used for 5-fold cross validation
