Implementation of common learning algorithms, such as SVMs, Naive Bayes, and Random Trees
- main.py
- data2.py - handles data manipulation
- libsvm.py - handles reading the raw data (could be implemented in data2.py to improve organization and compactness of the code)
- decisiontree.py
- gradient_search.py
- ML_magic.py - toolbox of machine learning algorithms (If I were retaking the class I would separate this file into individual files for each algorithm, plus tuning related functions would also be contained in an individual file
