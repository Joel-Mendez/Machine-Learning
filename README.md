# Machine-Learning

Documenting programming projects related to my graduate level machine learning class (CS 6350 taught by Dr. Vivek Srikumar at the University of Utah)

## Folders:
- Decision Trees: Implementation of decision tree algorithm with 5-fold cross validation. 
- Perceptron: Implementation of perceptron algorithm and its variants
- SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests: Implementation of common machine learning techniques and a combination of techniques
- Final Project: Gait phase estimation in exoskeleton hip assistance via leas-square regression with stochastic gradient descent
